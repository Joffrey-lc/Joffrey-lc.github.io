### Table

```latex
\begin{table}[]
    \centering
    \caption{The performance ratio between the MISO and SISO system various with the number of RISS passive elements and Rician factor.}
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}
    \hline
    % \toprule
    \textbf{Cond.} &  $N\to \infty$&  $\kappa_{h,k}\to \infty$& $\kappa_{h,k}\to 0$ & $\kappa_G\to \infty$ & $\kappa_G\to 0$ \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Ratio}& $M$ & $\frac{NMk_{G}+1}{Nk_{G}+1}\leq M$ & $\frac{Mk_{G}+1}{k_{G}+1}\leq M$ & $M$ &  $1$\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular} \label{table:condratio}

### Upper or Lower Equation

```latex
\begin{figure*}[ht]
    \begin{align}
     &\alpha_{E}=\frac{N\left(NM\kappa_h\kappa_G+M\kappa_G+\kappa_h+1\right)^2}{N\left(\kappa_G^2M^2+\kappa_h^2+1\right)+2\left(\kappa_h\kappa_GMN\left(\kappa_GMN+\kappa_hN+N+5\right)+\left(N+1\right)\left(\kappa_GM+\kappa_h\right)+\left(\kappa_GM+\kappa_h+1\right)\right)},\label{eqn:alpha_E}\\
	&\beta_{E}=\frac{\left(\varrho_{H2U}P_E\right)^{-1}\left(NM\kappa_h\kappa_G+M\kappa_G+\kappa_h+1\right)\left(1+\kappa_h\right)\left(1+\kappa_G\right)}{N\left(\kappa_G^2M^2+\kappa_h^2+1\right)+2\left(\kappa_h\kappa_GMN\left(\kappa_GMN+\kappa_hN+N+5\right)+\left(N+1\right)\left(\kappa_GM+\kappa_h\right)+\left(\kappa_GM+\kappa_h+1\right)\right)},\label{eqn:beta_E}

## Response utils

Refer to [MyGithub](https://github.com/Joffrey-lc/myResponseTemplate) for the Response Template.

### Number the figures in the order shown in the manuscript

```latex
\counterwithout{figure}{section}
\setcounter{figure}{9}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{pic/exp5_1.eps}
    \setlength{\abovecaptionskip}{0pt}
    \setlength{\belowcaptionskip}{0pt} 
    \caption{The outage probability of proposed scheme varies with $M$, $N$ and required energy threshold. The transmit power is set to 1 W, while $\kappa_h$ and $\kappa_G$ are both set to 10.}
    \label{fig:exp5}
\end{figure}
```

### Number the figures in the order shown in the Response

```latex
\counterwithin{figure}{section}
\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\setlength{\abovecaptionskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\belowcaptionskip}{0pt} 
	\includegraphics [width=0.4\linewidth]{pic/angleRecip.eps}
	\caption{The incident angle (i.e., AOA) for the uplink is represented by $\theta_1$, while the reflection angle (i.e., AOD) is represented by $\theta_2$. Similarly, the incidence and reflection angles for the downlink are represented by $\theta_3$ and $\theta_1$, respectively}\label{fig:angleRecip}
\end{figure}
